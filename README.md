Abstract:
This manuscript presents the design intent for a novel autonomous robotic system for  targeted use on invasive plant species and insect pest management, agricultural work, and ecological surveillance missions. The modular, scalable system can grow into a distributed AI Network Cluster (AINC), capable of orchestrating multi-module protocols. It is designed to operate autonomously in both wildland and agricultural settings, focusing on species such as cheatgrass, Scotch Broom, Gorse and large cane Brambles. Core innovations include a decoupled solar weed killer system, a chassis-integrated advanced sensor array for diagnostics and monitoring, and adaptability for diverse missions, including optional LiDAR for GPS-denied areas. A key feature is the system's ability to precisely target and control invasive species while minimizing ecological impact and collecting data on native pollinator populations, especially ground-nesting bees. This work is released under a Creative Commons license to encourage open collaboration and rapid development.

I'm a bit new here. Many Moons Ago I wrote a small obsolete Mini Howto for the Linux Documentation Project. Technology has left me behind since then. I've been reading about Global Warming looking at past episodes to get an idea of what is coming up. At the end of the last ice age there was a period of global warming that moved the earths deserts around a little. The Sahara and other deserts went green for 5 or more years. Expecting it would happen again I blundered over "Global Dryland Greening" It is the modern version of the same old thing. I was talking with Google AI about the subject and the answer ended up being Cheatgrass, an invasive species, was the green being observed in the Great Basin area. We continued chatting about grass control. Not a simple subject. Most formes of control become quickly obsolete. Grass adapts and evolves quickly. I inquired about Lasers and was shown that units already exist and that they are expensive, heavy energy hogs that are expensive and have poor market penetration.

I remembered being a kid with a magnifying glass doing things to Bugs I'm no longer proud of. But I inquired with the AI about building a solar collector that could focus sunlight onto a 2 lense focusing system and what it would do to cost and battery needs as a weed killer. The answer was direct, smaller battery larger operational radius less expensive. The document has outgrown the large language model so that partnership as it regards this model is over. Google AI mode sent me to you hoping the community might find something interesting or that fits in with Open Source Ethics and Interests.
